#Find the factorial of a number using a while loop

# number to find the factorial of
number = 6   

# start with our product equal to one
product = 1

# track the current number being multiplied
current = 1

# write your while loop here

product = 1 #start with product
current = 1 #track number being multiplied

while current <= number:
    product *= current

    # multiply the product so far by the current number
    
    
    # increment current with each iteration until it reaches number



# print the factorial of number
