# Write a for loop that iterates over a list of strings, tokens, and counts how many of them are XML tags. 
# XML is a data language similar to HTML.
# You can assume that the list of strings will not contain empty strings.

tokens = ['<greeting>', 'Hello World!', '</greeting>']
count = 2

# write your for loop here

tokens = ["<greeting>", "</greeting>"]
for x in tokens:
    print (x)

print(count)
