# Use list indexing to determine how many days are in a particular month based on the integer variable month, 
# and store that value in the integer variable num_days. For example, if month is 8, num_days should be set to 31, since the eighth month, August, has 31 days

month = 8
days_in_month = [31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31]

# use list indexing to determine the number of days in month

month = ['January']
num_days = 31
print(num_days)
